/Users/kushagrasrivastva/Desktop/ReelShortBlocker/app/build.gradle:31: Warning: Unknown issue id "Deprecation" [UnknownIssueId]
           warning 'Deprecation'
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnknownIssueId":
   Lint will report this issue if it is configured with an issue id it does
   not recognize in for example Gradle files or lint.xml configuration files.

/Users/kushagrasrivastva/Desktop/ReelShortBlocker/app/build.gradle:36: Warning: A newer version of androidx.appcompat:appcompat than 1.6.1 is available: 1.7.1 [GradleDependency]
       implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1'
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/kushagrasrivastva/Desktop/ReelShortBlocker/app/src/main/res/mipmap/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://material.io/design/iconography/) your launcher icons should "use a
   distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional, front view, with a slight
   perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

/Users/kushagrasrivastva/Desktop/ReelShortBlocker/app/src/main/res/mipmap/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: The following unrelated icon files have identical contents: ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png [IconDuplicates]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicates":
   If an icon is repeated under different names, you can consolidate and just
   use one of the icons and delete the others to make your application
   smaller. However, duplicated icons usually are not intentional and can
   sometimes point to icons that were accidentally overwritten or accidentally
   not updated.

/Users/kushagrasrivastva/Desktop/ReelShortBlocker/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:11: Warning: Hardcoded string "ReelShortBlocker", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
        android:text="ReelShortBlocker"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
